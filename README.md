# TheMovieDB

##Architecture:
The architecture is VIPER with a builder to handle the responsability of creation of each module. The Details Module as no logics were set for an interactor is an MVP+R.

##Network request:
Combine was used for networking.

##Third party libraries:
No third party libraries were used on the app. Therefore no package manager is used either.

##Conifg file

A config file was added for protecting the sensible information of the app. In this case the API key

##Reusable components
CustomAlertView, EmptyStateView, CircleRatingView and Loader were components created and able to be reused all over the app. Screenshots and videos are attached
